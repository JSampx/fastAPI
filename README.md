- FastAPI
- Docker

Feel confortable to share suggestions and upgrades.


### Instructions


#### Run docker
The first step after cloning or downloading the repository is 
run docker-compose file and run the command <code>docker-compose up</code>.
It has commands to download and install 
the docker images from Docker Hub. 
I choose the minimmal size images to run this exercise. 
After that, open the web browser at <localhost:8000>.

With the initial page opened, you'll see a simple JSON 
The root url for our api is [localhost:8000](/api/v1/cursos).
